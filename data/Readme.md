# Breakdown of the Filename Format

1. #### Prefix (s0001): The first part (s0001) could indicate a category, subject ID, or some other classification. The 's' might stand for "subject" or "sample"

2. #### Middle Section (00001): This part may represent a unique identifier for the image within the context of the prefix. It could denote a sequence number, frame number, or another type of identifier

3. #### Subsequent Numbers (0_0_0_0_0): The series of zeros could represent various attributes associated with the image, such as:

    * Conditions under which the image was taken (e.g., lighting, angle).
    * Metadata related to the experiment or dataset (e.g., trial number, camera settings).

4. #### Suffix (01): The final number before the file extension might indicate a version number or a specific instance of the image (e.g., multiple captures under similar conditions)

5. #### File Extension (png) Indicates that the file is an image in PNG format
